This caches a bunch of data into the resque parent process and then accesses it
in the worker. This is designed to test the memory sharing semantics of resque
parent / child forking and see if this could be a possible solution to some of
our RAM pains around the canned_reports system.

## Install:

Be sure you have a running redis.

  bundle

## Start the sinatra rack app

  $ rackup

## start the worker:

  $ QUEUE=* rake resque:work

## Enqueue a job

Visit http://localhost:9292/ or whatever your rack app started under.
